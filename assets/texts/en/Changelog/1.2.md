* **New:** Redirecting from Pleroma instances is now supported.
* **New:** Notifications are shown if the redirect fails or the add-on is not correctly set up.
* **Enhanced:** The verification of the Mastodon account in the options page is now improved, i.e. also checks whether the actual Mastodon account exists.
* **Enhanced:** Mastodon toot interaction redirection uses website scraping again as a fallback.

**Note:** Due to the introduction of error notifications, the add-on requests a new permission to show these notifications. See https://github.com/rugk/mastodon-simplified-federation/blob/main/assets/texts/en/permissions.md for an explanation of all permissions.
