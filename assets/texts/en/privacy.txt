Definitions:
ADD-ON – the software that this policy applies to
USER – the USER of the ADD-ON
REMOTE SERVER – a server on the internet, identified by a server address (domain name)
REMOTE USER – a USER account saved on a server on the internet, consists of a USER's name and the server address a USER is registered on, the REMOTE SERVER
REMOTE MESSAGE – any form of message, including but not limited to text, multimedia, audio and video; published by a REMOTE USER and saved on a REMOTE SERVER

This ADD-ON does not send any personally identifiable information to the ADD-ON author.

OWN ACCOUNT – a USER account saved on a server on the internet, consists of a USER's name and the server address, the USER of the ADD-ON has declared in the settings of this ADD-ON that this account is owned by them
OWN SERVER – the server on the internet, identified by a server address (domain name); the USER of the ADD-ON has declared in the settings of this ADD-ON to have saved it's OWN ACCOUNT on this server

If an Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in a specified way is accessed, that indicates you are trying to follow REMOTE USER or otherwise interact with the REMOTE USER or a REMOTE MESSAGE published by a REMOTE USER on a REMOTE SERVER, it can redirect the USER to a server you have specified in the settings of the ADD-ON as an OWN SERVER.
To do so, the ADD-ON may contact the REMOTE SERVER and LOCAL SERVER and send information about the REMOTE USER and REMOTE MESSAGE.
Additionally, it may send information about the OWN ACCOUNT and OWN SERVER to OWN SERVER.

The ADD-ON will not send information about your OWN ACCOUNT or OWN SERVER to any REMOTE SERVER. If that case should inadvertently happen, it is considered a vulnerability in the ADD-ON.
It may happen, however, that the REMOTE SERVER is the same as the OWN SERVER. In such a case, the ADD-ON works the same and may thus send all the information to it's own server.

An explanation of all permissions, this ADD-ON requests, can be found at https://github.com/rugk/mastodon-simplified-federation/blob/main/assets/texts/en/permissions.md.

== IMPLICATIONS ==

There are two implications this add-on causes:
1. As the USER does not need to enter your Mastodon handle anymore on any website, this can result in a privacy advantage.
2. However, please mind that websites may still detect that the USER uses this add-on by triggering a redirect as if the USER clicked on a button. The USER will likely see this.

== THIRD-PARTY SERVICES ==

This ADD-ON uses the “sync storage” of your browser to store the settings. If the USER enables “Sync” in the browser, the settings are uploaded and synchronized across your devices connected to your account. If you do not do, the data is only stored locally on your device.
In Mozilla Firefox the data is end-to-end encrypted before getting uploaded and stored on servers by Mozilla.
See https://accounts.firefox.com/legal/privacy and https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/#c-privacy-topic-8 for Mozilla's privacy policies on that topic.
